Exercise Tracker using Nutritionix API and Google Sheets
This script is designed to track your exercises by utilizing the Nutritionix API to retrieve exercise details and then storing the information in a Google Sheets document.

Prerequisites
Before using this script, make sure you have the following:

Python installed on your machine.
The requests library installed. You can install it using the following command:
API credentials and endpoint information from Nutritionix and Google Sheets.
Setup
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Create a file named config.py in the same directory as the script, and include the following information:



APP_ID = "your_nutritionix_app_id"
API_KEY = "your_nutritionix_api_key"
AUTHORIZATION = "your_google_sheets_authorization"
SHEET_ENDPOINT = "your_google_sheets_endpoint"
GENDER = "your_gender"
WEIGHT_KG = "your_weight_in_kg"
HEIGHT_CM = "your_height_in_cm"
AGE = "your_age"
Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials and information.

Run the script:

bash
python your_script_name.py
Enter the exercise you did today when prompted.

How It Works
The script sends a request to the Nutritionix API to get details about the specified exercise.

If the request is successful (HTTP status code 200), the exercise details are extracted, and a new request is made to add the exercise information to a Google Sheets document.

The Google Sheets request also includes additional information such as date, time, and user details.

If both requests are successful, the script prints a success message. Otherwise, it prints an error message along with the status code and response text.

Note
Ensure that you have a stable internet connection for the script to communicate with the Nutritionix API and Google Sheets.

Keep your API credentials and sensitive information secure. Do not share them publicly.

This script serves as a basic template and can be expanded or modified based on your specific requirements.
